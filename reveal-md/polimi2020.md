# Introduction to intellectual property

Milano, <!-- FIXME: DATE -->

## The wording "Intellectual Property" is a misnomer

- <!--frag semi-fade-out index 1 --> It is a **collective name** for a plethora of different subjects
- <!--frag fade-in-then-semi-out index 1 --> These subjects are held together by a very few common traits
  - exclusionary rights (or *negative* rights)
  - a law establishing them (require a legal framework)
- <!--frag--> They don't exist in nature

---

## A quick list

- copyright
- patents (family)
- trademarks
- trade secrets
- database rights

---

# Quelle petite Diff√©rence

![](assets/img/giraffes.svg)

---

# How do they differ?

- Conditions to obtain them
- Territorial scope
- Scope of protection
- Duration

---

# Conditions to obtain them

----

## copyright

- Berne convention
- Fixation
- **automatic**
- No further requirements
- *Gratis*

----

## Patents, Trademarks

- Application
- Examination by an office
- Public grant
- Pay a fee

----

## Trade secrets

- keep something... secret
- keep it protected

----

## Database sui generis rights

- automatic
- relevant investment in collecting, organizing, presenting data

---

# Territorial scope

- copyright, trade secrets: **worldwide** <!--frag-->
- patents, trademarks: **state-by-state** <!--frag-->
- database rights: **EU only** <!--frag-->

---

# Scope of protection

- copyright: **Original creation** <!--frag-->
- patents (inventions): **new way to resolve a technical problem** <!--frag-->
- trademarks: **distinctiveness (product, service, brand)** <!--frag-->
- database rights: **dataset, substantial part** <!--frag-->
- trade secrets: **secrecy of valuable information** <!--frag-->

---
# Duration


- Copyright: **Life + 70 years** <!--frag-->
- patents (inventions): **~20 years from first claimed priority** <!--frag-->
- trademarks: **forever until renewed** <!--frag-->
- trade secrets: **forever until secret** <!--frag-->
- database rights: **15 years from last substantial investment** <!--frag-->

---

# Protection of software

---

## What is relevant

- Copyright (code, as a literary works)
- Patents (ways of using code to resolve "technical problems")
- Trade secrets (source vs. object/obfuscated)
- Trademark ("product")
- Database rights (residual)

---

## Patent vs. copyright

What do they cover:

- patents cover the idea, copyright the form of expression
- copyright does not cover facts, data
- patents do not cover software as such @fa[laugh-squint fa-2x fa-red fragment]

---

## Patent vs. copyright

How do you infringe:

- patent: stumble in one claim
  - even if innocent, unbeknonwst to you
- copyright: you must copy
  - assessment: probabilistic
- don't forget moral rights

---

## Copyright on distributed code

- no license, conditions = "all rights reserved"
- EULA
- sell all rights
- public license, open source

---

# Open Source (Free Software)

---

## What is open Source

In a nutshell, a set of public licenses that grant *everybody* some liberties:

- use the software
- study the software
- modify the software
- distribute original or modified software

<!--frag-->Well, that's Free Software an those are the 4 liberties...

---

## The OSD

Open source is technically software licensed under conditions of a license that complies with the open source definition, stewarded by the Open Source Initiative <https://opensource.org>

But that only tells a part of the story.

----

## The whole story

Open source is about how the software  

- <!--frag-->is created
- <!--frag-->is distributed
- <!--frag-->is maintained
- <!--frag-->can be used, modified, studied
- <!--frag-->...

---

## Inbound vs Outbound Licensing, derivative software

Nobody writes software from scratch!

- <!--frag--> You take some code
- <!--frag--> That code has its own conditions
- <!--frag--> Conditions of software you are reusing is called **inbound**
- <!--frag--> Conditions of software you are *distributing* is called **outbound**
- <!--frag--> If software contains substantial fragments of other software, it is a **derivative**.
- <!--frag--> Derivative software needs permission from the original(s)

---

# Why is it important to know?

A license can be very simple and just permit whatever to whomever. But with most licenses, **permission** is granted only *provided that* you comply with **conditions**


- <!--frag--> **If** condition is complied with, **then** you can {modify, distribute original or modified software}
- <!--frag-->  **If** condition **is not** complied with, **then** you cannot {modify, distribute original or modified software}


----

## Is this "copyleft"?

No, copyleft is a *subclass* of  Free Software conditions.

- <!--frag--> Conditions impact on **outbound** software, and outbound license
- <!--frag--> One condition is **"inbound license == outbound license"**
- <!--frag--> Depending on the scope of this condition (just the library, the file or the entire derivative), we have **"strong"** or **"weak copyleft"**

---

## A Clash of Licenses

The more conditions and the stricter, the more likely you have **incompatibilities**: there is no state in which you can comply with both.

---

# We call it **"compliance"** <!--frag-->
