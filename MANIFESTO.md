## Manifesto

### Why not to use standard WYSIWYG editors (MS Word, Libreoffice, Pages, etc.)?

Because for certain scopes of use, it is fundamental to focus on text content and structure and not on formatting, and keep the two things separated. 

Because WYSIWYG editors usually mess around with ordered lists, numbered sections, revisions, etc., especially when the same document has to be edited with different versions of the same editor or with different editors (e.g. MS Word and Libreoffice).

Because the same document may need to be published in different formats and contexts (website, review, etc.), and conversions made by WYSIWYG editors are usually messy and require manual adjustments - while it would be better to have a single source document, without any formatting, that can be compiled into any format.

Because certain kinds of documents must be always easily accessible and readable over time with any simple text editor (and not tied to a format fully supported only by specific versions of a specific WYSIWYG editor). 

### Why Markdown?

Because even if it has not a unique standard syntax, all of its syntax variants / flavors are simple and layman-readable. 

Because even a geeky, non-layman gal/guy, when reading and writing a text, is better off if she/he can concentrate only on content and structure and not on the syntax itself (which would be hard if the syntax is complex and "noisy").

Because, even if with some variants, Markdown is a *de facto* standard.

### Why Pandoc?

Because it powerful and easily extendable, it supports many formats and standards, and works on different platforms.
